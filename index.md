## Summary
In my second milestone, I completed many of essential functions of my robot. The most challenging and important was getting the camera to detect the ball and create a mask around it. I also programmed the motors to turn the robot to face the ball and drive toward it. Additionally, I moved around certain parts of my robot as I finalized the position of each component. At the end of this milestone, the final shape and functionality of my robot really began to take shape.

## Summary
Ultimately the goal for this project is to use the PIcam and OpenCV track a ball and use the motors and ultrasonic sensos to navigate toward it, as well as avoid any obstacles. For my first milestone, I constructed the main body of the car and wired each of my components. I downloaded Raspberry Pi OS on my Raspberry Pi and finished setting it up. I connected the camera, ultrasonic sensor and the motors. Additionally, I tested basic functionality of each of my components using some code.

## Components Used
- Raspberry Pi minicomputer
    - The Rasbperry Pi is the heart of the project and provides instructions to each of the other components of the robot. The Raspberry Pi is a microcomputer where the user can load or write programs onto. In addition to directing the instructions, the Raspberry Pi provides power to many of the other components.
- DC motors
    - These motors are used to drive the wheels and control the movement of the robot. This motor works by making use of an electromagnet which constantly switches its polarity by switching the direction of the current. This current direction switch is made possible with the commutator and brushes of the motor, which allows for the motor to constantly spin. 
- Ultrasonic sensors
    - The ultrasonic sensors allow the robot to know where it is in relation to the ball and any other objects in the room. These sensors work by sending out an ultrasound from the transmittor (trigger pin) and receiving it from the receiver (echo pin). By using some simple calculations including the speed of sound and dividing the final distance by 2 to account for both distances traveled, the ultrasonic sensor is very useful in applications such as this.
- L298N motor driver board
    - A dual H-Bridge motor driver board which makes use of a multitude of transistors, allows for this device to control the direction and speed of two different motors, making it a very useful addition for a project such as this. The Raspberry Pi alone is not powerful enough to run the motors, so the driver board also provides power to the motors.

## Challenges 
I faced various difficulties while setting up my Raspberry Pi. First, I installed the wrong version of the OS. Additionally, I encountered numerous issues with displaying the contents of my Raspberry Pi on my laptop. I initally attempetd to use RealVNC Viewer, however connecting to the Raspberry Pi was inconsistent and failed often. I connected the Raspberry Pi to my laptop with a video capture card and used OBS to view the contents. I connected a wireless mouse and keyboard to the Raspberrry Pi and was able to interact with the desktop while viewing the video output on OBS.

## What's Next?
The next major goal for my project is to get the Picamera to recognize and track the ball, using OpenCV. Once this has been achieved, the majority of the project has been finished and I can begin integrating the rest of the functionality of my robot.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/flsPcG2cskM?si=XTX2YYClHUA8_DDp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Summary
For my starter project, I chose to build a handheld game console. The project combines multiple different components in order to capture inputs, display them on an LED display, and keep track of score. The IC chip is soldered onto the board and takes inputs from the switch and various buttons. The chip is connected to the LED dot matrix, allowing it to display the game pieces and any inputs provided by the player. Additionally, the chip controls the score counter and the buzzer to create noise.
## Components Used
- IC chip
- Buzzer
- LED Dot Matrix
- PCB
- Digitron Display
- Electric Capacitor



## Challenges faced
Soldering was difficult on the board, as each component was small and intricate. There were many different connection points required for each component and it was tedious to solder each wire. This was my first time ever soldering and my inexperience added to the difficulty. One problem I faced was pressing each component firmly into its slot while soldering. One trick I used was to press the component in and solder two wires on opposite sides. This held the component in place, making the rest of the soldering fairly simple. Overall, I found that it was effective to work slowly and carefully. It is much more difficult to remove solder from somewhere it shouldn't be. 

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
